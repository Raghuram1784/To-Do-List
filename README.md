# To-Do-List
This is a simple **to-do list** website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Users can enter their tasks or to-do items in a search bar and manage them on the webpage.


# Features 
- **Add Tasks** :  Users can enter tasks in the search bar and add them to the list using either the Enter key or an "Add" button.
- **Validation** :  If the user tries to add a task with an empty input (by pressing Enter or clicking the "Add" button without entering anything), a message **"ðŸš¨ Task cannot be empty âœŽ"** will be displayed.
- **Delete Tasks** :  Users can delete individual tasks by clicking on them. There is also an option to delete all tasks at once.
- **Task Status** :  The website shows the total number of tasks, how many tasks are completed, and how many are pending.
- **Persistence** :  Tasks are stored **locally** in the browser, so they remain even if the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens the website.
